> A curated list of awesome [remark][] (a Markdown processor and a [unified][]
> project) resources.

**remark** is not another Markdown to HTML compiler.
It can generate and reformat Markdown too.
Powered by plugins to do all kinds of things: check Markdown code style,
transform safely to React, add a table of contents, or compile to man pages,
and much more.

**unified** is an interface for processing text using syntax trees.
It’s what powers remark, but also [retext][] and [rehype][].
It’s part of the [unified][] collective.
