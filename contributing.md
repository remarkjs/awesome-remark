## Contributions

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* **The project should’ve existed at least 30 days before submitting**.
  This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it’s not just a
  publish-and-forget type of project
* Use the following format: `*   [package](link)\n    — description`
* Descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
  Start the description with a lower-case letter, end without a
  full-stop/period
* If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list,
  argue how it’s better
* Suggested packages should be tested and documented
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome,
  but should be done in a separate pull request

Thank you for your suggestion!
